# MNIST_Digit_Classification
machine learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model learned to recognize and accurately predict digits (0-9) from image data. Using techniques like neural networks and model training, I achieved accurate predictions, helping the system automatically recognize and classify handwritten numbers.
